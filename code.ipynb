    "Here are some things that often go into teacher comments:\n",

    "difficulty, seeks out extra help, etc.)\n",
    "3. A summary of some key exam grades or essay excerpts.\n",
    "4. A suggestion for what to improve on or what to do for extra enrichment.\n",
    "5. A summary of the semester grade and a closing sentence.\n",
    "Here are some some common errors that teachers dread making when they copy and paste:\n",
    "1. Writing the wrong student name!\n",
    "2. Getting the wrong pronoun! (He/she/they, him/her/theirs, etc.)\n",
    "Your task:\n",
    "1. Take in a teacher spreadsheet file (teacher.csv) that contains all of the info on each student\n",
    "(perhaps you will need columns for student attributes, essay excerpts or grades, etc.)\n",
    "2. Write a personalized comment to a separate file for each student’s name (kanye.txt,\n",
    "miley.txt, etc.)\n",
    "3. Make the teacher’s comments even better than the original! Add something of value that is\n",
    "not already in the teacher’s comment. What as a student would you want to see in the\n",
    "comments that would make them for informative to you?\n",
    "Some considerations:\n",
    "1. As with real teacher comments, the more personalized and descriptive you can be about\n",
    "each student, the better.\n",
    "2. You want your program to be dynamic and generalizable to other students besides the two\n",
    "sample comments given.\n",
    "3. Your program needs to be READABLE, since it will be used by someone other than you.\n",
    "Therefore, it needs to be commented well AND you need to make use of functions for\n",
    "readability. For example, if you write code to make sure that pronouns are correct, you will put\n",
    "that calculation separately in a function called “pronouns”.\n",
    "4. In your groups, each person should be in charge of different functions. Then, all of your\n",
    "functions need to work together to create the final product.\n",
